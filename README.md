Data for the NCMEC and Cloudera Cares GHCOSD 17 project

The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a nonprofit  corporation whose mission is to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation, and prevent child victimization. Cloudera Cares is the philanthropic arm of Cloudera.

Project: Preventing Child Abductions

Create an interactive map of attempted abductions that allows NCMEC to more easily visualize the data to analyze for possible trends/patterns/related incidents. This would be used to disseminate information to both law enforcement and the public in a more efficient manner. Building an interface automatically populates information based on our preset of parameters.
